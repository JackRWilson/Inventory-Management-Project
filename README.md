# Project Overview

Inventory management is essential for any grocery store. It helps track popular sales, total assets, and restock on diminishing items.

This small inventory management database is part of an assignment and is used as coding practice rather than a practical tracking system.

Products need to be entered manually and will save to `inventory.csv` when exiting, to be opened the next time the program is run.

A list of database options is shown upon running `inventory_management.py`.
